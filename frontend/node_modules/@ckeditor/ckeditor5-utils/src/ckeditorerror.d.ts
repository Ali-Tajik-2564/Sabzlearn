/**
 * The CKEditor error class.
 *
 * You should throw `CKEditorError` when:
 *
 * * An unexpected situation occurred and the editor (most probably) will not work properly. Such exception will be handled
 * by the {@link module:watchdog/watchdog~Watchdog watchdog} (if it is integrated),
 * * If the editor is incorrectly integrated or the editor API is used in the wrong way. This way you will give
 * feedback to the developer as soon as possible. Keep in mind that for common integration issues which should not
 * stop editor initialization (like missing upload adapter, wrong name of a toolbar component) we use
 * {@link module:utils/ckeditorerror~logWarning `logWarning()`} and
 * {@link module:utils/ckeditorerror~logError `logError()`}
 * to improve developers experience and let them see the a working editor as soon as possible.
 *
 * ```ts
 * /**
 *  * Error thrown when a plugin cannot be loaded due to JavaScript errors, lack of plugins with a given name, etc.

 *  * @param pluginName The name of the plugin that could not be loaded.
 *  * @param moduleName The name of the module which tried to load this plugin.
