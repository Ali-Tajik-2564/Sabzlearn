/**
 * Represents a position in the model tree.
 *
 * A position is represented by its {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#root} and
 * a {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#path} in that root.
 *
 * You can create position instances via its constructor or the `createPosition*()` factory methods of
 * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model} and {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}.
 *
 * **Note:** Position is based on offsets, not indexes. This means that a position between two text nodes
 * `foo` and `bar` has offset `3`, not `1`. See {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#path} for more information.
 *
 * Since a position in the model is represented by a {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#root position root} and
 * {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#path position path} it is possible to create positions placed in non-existing places.
 * This requirement is important for operational transformation algorithms.
 *
 * Also, {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation operations}
 * kept in the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#history document history}
 * are storing positions (and ranges) which were correct when those operations were applied, but may not be correct
 * after the document has changed.
 *
 * When changes are applied to the model, it may also happen that {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#parent position parent}
 * will change even if position path has not changed. Keep in mind, that if a position leads to non-existing element,
 * {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#parent} and some other properties and methods will throw errors.
 *
 * In most cases, position with wrong path is caused by an error in code, but it is sometimes needed, as described above.
