/**
 * `Marker` is a continuous part of the model (like a range), is named and represents some kind of information about the
 * marked part of the model document. In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of
 * the model document tree, markers are not stored directly in the document tree but in the
 * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving
 * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.
 *
 * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is
 * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).
 * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that
 * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being
 * "special" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document
 * model, it starts being "special" and the marker is enlarged.
 *
 * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes
 * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree. Marker gives instant access
 * to the range which it is marking at the moment.
 *
 * Markers are built from a name and a range.
 *
 * Range of the marker is updated automatically when document changes, using
 * {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live range} mechanism.
 *
 * Name is used to group and identify markers. Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by
 * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating
 * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in
 * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.
 * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'update:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.
 *
 * There are two types of markers.
 *
 * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}
 * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism. They can be used
 * as bookmarks or visual markers. They are great for showing results of the find, or select link when the focus is in the input.
 *
 * 1. Markers managed using operations. These markers are also stored in {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}
 * but changes in these markers is managed the same way all other changes in the model structure - using operations.
 * Therefore, they are handled in the undo stack and synchronized between clients if the collaboration plugin is enabled.
 * This type of markers is useful for solutions like spell checking or comments.
 *
 * Both type of them should be added / updated by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#addMarker}
 * and removed by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#removeMarker} methods.
 *
 * ```ts
 * model.change( ( writer ) => {
 * 	const marker = writer.addMarker( name, { range, usingOperation: true } );
 *
 * 	// ...
 *
 * 	writer.removeMarker( marker );
 * } );
 * ```
 *
 * See {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer} to find more examples.
 *
 * Since markers need to track change in the document, for efficiency reasons, it is best to create and keep as little
 * markers as possible and remove them as soon as they are not needed anymore.
 *
 * Markers can be downcasted and upcasted.
 *
 * Markers downcast happens on {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} and
 * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} events.
 * Use {@link module:engine/conversion/downcasthelpers downcast converters} or attach a custom converter to mentioned events.
 * For {@link module:engine/controller/datacontroller~DataController data pipeline}, marker should be downcasted to an element.
 * Then, it can be upcasted back to a marker. Again, use {@link module:engine/conversion/upcasthelpers upcast converters} or
 * attach a custom converter to {@link module:engine/conversion/upcastdispatcher~UpcastDispatcher#event:element}.
 *
 * `Marker` instances are created and destroyed only by {@link ~MarkerCollection MarkerCollection}.
