 * Performs a transformation of two sets of operations - `operationsA` and `operationsB`. The transformation is two-way -

 *
 * Note, that the first operation in each set should base on the same document state (
 * {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#version document version}).
 *
 * It is assumed that `operationsA` are "more important" during conflict resolution between two operations.
 *
 * New copies of both passed arrays and operations inside them are returned. Passed arguments are not altered.
 *
 * Base versions of the transformed operations sets are updated accordingly. For example, assume that base versions are `4`
 * and there are `3` operations in `operationsA` and `5` operations in `operationsB`. Then:
 *
 * * transformed `operationsA` will start from base version `9` (`4` base version + `5` operations B),
 * * transformed `operationsB` will start from base version `7` (`4` base version + `3` operations A).
 *
 * If no operation was broken into two during transformation, then both sets will end up with an operation that bases on version `11`:
 *
 * * transformed `operationsA` start from `9` and there are `3` of them, so the last will have `baseVersion` equal to `11`,
 * * transformed `operationsB` start from `7` and there are `5` of them, so the last will have `baseVersion` equal to `11`.
 *
 * @param operationsA
 * @param operationsB
 * @param options Additional transformation options.
 * @param options.document Document which the operations change.
 * @param options.useRelations Whether during transformation relations should be used (used during undo for better conflict resolution).
 * @param options.padWithNoOps Whether additional {@link module:engine/model/operation/nooperation~NoOperation}s
 * should be added to the transformation results to force the same last base version for both transformed sets (in case
 * if some operations got broken into multiple operations during transformation).
 * @param options.forceWeakRemove If set to `false`, remove operation will be always stronger than move operation,
 * so the removed nodes won't end up back in the document root. When set to `true`, context data will be used.
 * @returns Transformation result.
