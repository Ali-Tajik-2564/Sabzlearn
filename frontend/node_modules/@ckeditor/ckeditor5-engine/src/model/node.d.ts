/**
 * Model node. Most basic structure of model tree.
 *
 * This is an abstract class that is a base for other classes representing different nodes in model.
 *
 * **Note:** If a node is detached from the model tree, you can manipulate it using it's API.
 * However, it is **very important** that nodes already attached to model tree should be only changed through
 * {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer Writer API}.
 *
 * Changes done by `Node` methods, like {@link module:engine/model/element~Element#_insertChild _insertChild} or
 * {@link module:engine/model/node~Node#_setAttribute _setAttribute}
 * do not generate {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation operations}
 * which are essential for correct editor work if you modify nodes in {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document} root.
 *
 * The flow of working on `Node` (and classes that inherits from it) is as such:
 * 1. You can create a `Node` instance, modify it using it's API.
 * 2. Add `Node` to the model using `Batch` API.
 * 3. Change `Node` that was already added to the model using `Batch` API.
 *
 * Similarly, you cannot use `Batch` API on a node that has not been added to the model tree, with the exception
 * of {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#insert inserting} that node to the model tree.
 *
 * Be aware that using {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#remove remove from Batch API} does not allow to use `Node` API because
 * the information about `Node` is still kept in model document.
 *
 * In case of {@link module:engine/model/element~Element element node}, adding and removing children also counts as changing a node and
 * follows same rules.
