     *
     * An execution of a feature may lead to an incorrect document tree state. The callbacks are used to fix the document tree after
     * it has changed. Post-fixers are fired just after all changes from the outermost change block were applied but
     * before the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change change event} is fired. If a post-fixer callback made

     * not be fixed in the new document tree state.
     *
     * As a parameter, a post-fixer callback receives a {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer writer} instance connected with the
     * executed changes block. Thanks to that, all changes done by the callback will be added to the same
     * {@link module:engine/model/batch~Batch batch} (and undo step) as the original changes. This makes post-fixer changes transparent
     * for the user.
     *
     * An example of a post-fixer is a callback that checks if all the data were removed from the editor. If so, the
     * callback should add an empty paragraph so that the editor is never empty:
     *
     * ```ts
     * document.registerPostFixer( writer => {
     * 	const changes = document.differ.getChanges();

     * 	// Check if the changes lead to an empty root in the editor.
     * 	for ( const entry of changes ) {
     * 		if ( entry.type == 'remove' && entry.position.root.isEmpty ) {
     * 			writer.insertElement( 'paragraph', entry.position.root, 0 );
     *
     * 			// It is fine to return early, even if multiple roots would need to be fixed.
     * 			// All post-fixers will be fired again, so if there are more empty roots, those will be fixed, too.
     * 			return true;
