 * calculate the {@link module:engine/view/position~Position view position}. The calculated view position should be added as
 * a `viewPosition` value in the `data` object that is passed as one of parameters to the event callback.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Assume that "captionedImage" model element is converted to <img> and following <span> elements in view,
 * // and the model element is bound to <img> element. Force mapping model positions inside "captionedImage" to that
 * // <span> element.

 *
 * 		// Stop the event if other callbacks should not modify calculated value.
 * 		evt.stop();
 * 	}
 * } );
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** keep in mind that sometimes a "phantom" model position is being converted. A "phantom" model position is
 * a position that points to a nonexistent place in model. Such a position might still be valid for conversion, though
 * (it would point to a correct place in the view when converted). One example of such a situation is when a range is
 * removed from the model, there may be a need to map the range's end (which is no longer a valid model position). To
 * handle such situations, check the `data.isPhantom` flag:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Assume that there is a "customElement" model element and whenever the position is before it,
 * // we want to move it to the inside of the view element bound to "customElement".
 * mapper.on( 'modelToViewPosition', ( evt, data ) => {
 * 	if ( data.isPhantom ) {
 * 		return;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	// Below line might crash for phantom position that does not exist in model.
 * 	const sibling = data.modelPosition.nodeBefore;
 *
 * 	// Check if this is the element we are interested in.
 * 	if ( !sibling.is( 'element', 'customElement' ) ) {
 * 		return;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	const viewElement = data.mapper.toViewElement( sibling );
 *
 * 	data.viewPosition = new ViewPosition( sibling, 0 );
 *
 * 	evt.stop();
 * } );
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** the default mapping callback is provided with a `low` priority setting and does not cancel the event, so it is possible to
 * attach a custom callback after a default callback and also use `data.viewPosition` calculated by the default callback
 * (for example to fix it).
 *
 * **Note:** the default mapping callback will not fire if `data.viewPosition` is already set.
 *
 * **Note:** these callbacks are called **very often**. For efficiency reasons, it is advised to use them only when position
 * mapping between the given model and view elements is unsolvable by using just elements mapping and default algorithm.
 * Also, the condition that checks if a special case scenario happened should be as simple as possible.
