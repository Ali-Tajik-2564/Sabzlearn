 * A helper that enables a placeholder on the provided view element (also updates its visibility).
 * The placeholder is a CSS pseudo–element (with a text content) attached to the element.
 *
 * To change the placeholder text, change value of the `placeholder` property in the provided `element`.
 *
 * To disable the placeholder, use {@link module:engine/view/placeholder~disablePlaceholder `disablePlaceholder()`} helper.
 *
 * @param options Configuration options of the placeholder.
 * @param options.view Editing view instance.
 * @param options.element Element that will gain a placeholder. See `options.isDirectHost` to learn more.
 * @param options.isDirectHost If set `false`, the placeholder will not be enabled directly
 * in the passed `element` but in one of its children (selected automatically, i.e. a first empty child element).
 * Useful when attaching placeholders to elements that can host other elements (not just text), for instance,
 * editable root elements.
 * @param options.text Placeholder text. It's **deprecated** and will be removed soon. Use
 * {@link module:engine/view/placeholder~PlaceholderableElement#placeholder `options.element.placeholder`} instead.
 * @param options.keepOnFocus If set `true`, the placeholder stay visible when the host element is focused.
